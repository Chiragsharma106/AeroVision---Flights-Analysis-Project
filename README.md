## About the Project
**AeroVision Airlines**, a mid-sized airline carrier, wanted to analyze its flight operations, bookings, and revenue trends across multiple years.  
The objective was to understand sales performance, optimize routes, track cancellations, and identify customer behavior patterns through a **unified Power BI dashboard**.

---

## The Problem ⛔
1. **Fragmented Flight & Sales Data**  
   - Flight, booking, and revenue records were scattered across spreadsheets.  
   - Leadership couldn’t get a holistic view for quick decision-making.  

2. **Lack of Centralized Performance Tracking**  
   - Bookings, cancellations, and ticket class distribution weren’t tracked in one place.  
   - Decision-making relied on partial or outdated data.  

3. **Route & Revenue Management Challenges**  
   - No clarity on consistently profitable vs. underperforming routes.  
   - Resource allocation (aircraft scheduling, pricing, staffing) was assumption-based.  

4. **No Visibility into Customer Behaviour**  
   - No way to analyze repeat bookings, loyalty, or customer cohorts.  
   - Couldn’t identify most valuable passengers or class-wise profitability.  

5. **Seasonality Blind Spots**  
   - No systematic tracking of seasonality or demand fluctuations.  
   - Forecasting, staffing, and promotional planning were inaccurate.

## Solution I Used ✅
1. **Comprehensive Power BI Dashboard**  
   - Integrated **2022–2025 data** into an interactive dashboard.  
   - Tabs included: *Overview, Details, Cohort Analysis, Geographical View, Flights Info, Time Analysis, Sales Flow*.  

2. **Flight-Level Insights**  
   - Identified **top flights by revenue**, tracked cancellations, class mix, avg. sales per day.  
   - Automated KPIs flagged highest/lowest revenue flights with YoY comparisons.  

3. **Route Profitability Mapping**  
   - Profitable routes like *Kolkata → Bengaluru (₹247,259, 6% contribution)* highlighted.  
   - Underperforming routes like *Ahmedabad → Mumbai* identified.  
   - **Pareto analysis** showed top 20% routes driving 80% revenue.  

4. **Seasonality & Time Trends**  
   - Monthly, quarterly, yearly sales trends visualized.  
   - *Q1 2023 → highest sales at ₹9.8M*, while *May 2025 saw decline*.  
   - Added **6-month moving averages** & **12-month rolling totals** for forecasting.  

5. **Customer Cohort & Class Segmentation**  
   - Cohort analysis revealed repeat booking trends.  
   - Segmentation by **Economy, Business, First Class** informed pricing & service strategies.
